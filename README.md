==========

You can download a report with results [here](https://github.com/bouchja1/MI-DIP-text) as PDF. The report is written in the Czech language.

The thesis describes design and development of an adaptive system that is able to appropriately choose and combine content-recommendation algorithms.

The first part of the thesis studies the theory related to advanced, already existing systems. Based on the results of this research, suitable learning strategy and particular system requirements were chosen.

The second part of this thesis is practical and describes the system design, general interface for communication, used technologies, and programmer’s approach used to get the resultant system.

Developed parts comprehend:

1. adaptive system
2. a set of basic algorithms for content recommendation
3. RESTful API
4. a client application that in the end made it possible to perform several experiments with the system.

All the application’s parts are implemented in Java programming language.
